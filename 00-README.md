# Interactive Art Diary Platform

## Commission Opportunities - 2 Design Projects

**Launch:** Q1 2026 Exhibition Debut  
**Vision:** Transform a deeply personal illustrated diary practice into an immersive digital experience  
**Opportunities:** Two distinct commissions for designers/developers (see below)

---

## Project Overview

Seven years ago, financial disaster and digital addiction brought a fledgling artist to rock bottom. Out of this collapse emerged an illustrated diary practice—page by page, image by image—that evolved into a systematic innovation for processing human experience.

Now 50+ artworks (from A4 pages to 1.5‑meter exhibition pieces) document this complete transformation. The project is preparing for its digital debut: an **"audiobook meets art gallery"** platform where visitors can explore narrated diary artworks through interactive hotspots, images, and data visualisations.

This repository contains the creative briefs, narrative context, and technical documentation required to bring this vision alive. We are currently seeking collaborators for two distinct commissions.

_This isn’t just another design project. It’s the digital gateway into a mythic journey from collapse into creativity—and your work will define how audiences experience it._

## Commission Opportunities

### 🎨 Opportunity 1: Interactive Gallery UI Design

**Scope:**  
Design the front-end interface of the main gallery experience — aesthetics, typography, layouts, navigation, micro-interactions, and the overall _feel_. Your role is to create the design system that will frame and elevate the artworks without overwhelming them.

**Core Challenge:**  
How to present highly detailed, black-and-white hand-drawn diary artworks with interactive hotspots, audio narration, and layered content — while keeping the experience intimate, elegant, and cross-device perfect.

**Timeline:** ~6-10 weeks development (design + implementation)

**Getting Started:**

1. [Narrative Highlights - 5m read](1-narrative/narrative-highlights-5min-read.md)  – Quick overview of key themes and beats
    
2. [Design Brief Highlights – 2m read](2-ui-design-brief/ui-design-brief-highlights-2m-read.md)– Essential requirements **OR** [Full Spec Design Brief – 6m read](2-ui-design-brief/ui-design-brief-full-6m-read.md) – Complete UI/UX specification
    
3. [Interaction Reference Guide – 3m read](x-interaction-reference-guide-3m-read.md) – Detailed interaction flows
    
4. [Supporting schemas and specs](4-diagrams/)– Hotspot schema, access gating, site map, feature specs
    
5. [Sample artworks](5-sample-pieces/) – Representative artwork samples for design reference

### 📜 Opportunity 2: Scrolling Homepage Story 

**Scope:**  
Design and develop a scroll-triggered homepage storytelling experience that acts as the _emotional gateway_ to the platform. Think **Snow Fall by NYT**, but for personal transformation: a short, powerful scroll experience (3–5 minutes) that hooks visitors before they enter the gallery.

**Core Challenge:**  
How to translate the diary’s transformation story into a visually striking, scroll-driven digital narrative that works beautifully on mobile, tablet, and desktop — and transitions seamlessly into the main gallery.

**Timeline:** ~6-10 weeks development (design + build)  

**Getting started:**

- [Prologue/Backstory-3min-read](1-narrative/a-prologue-backstory-3min-read) – Origins & foundational context

- [narrative-exhibition-acts-13m-read.md](1-narrative/narrative-exhibition-acts-13m-read.md) — Three-act transformation journey  

- [narrative-highlights-5min-read.md](1-narrative/narrative-highlights-5min-read.md) — Quick overview of story themes from both prologue and exhibition  

- [scrolling-homepage-brief-4m-read.md](3-scrolling-homepage-brief/scrolling-homepage-brief-4m-read.md) — Full creative brief for scroll experience  

- [site-map.md](4-diagrams/site-map.md) — Structural overview  

- [5-sample-artworks/](5-sample-artworks/) — Artwork samples for storytelling integration
