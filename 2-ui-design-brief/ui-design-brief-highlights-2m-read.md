## Interactive Art Diary Platform

_(Full details: [UI Design Brief – Full Spec (6m read)](ui-design-brief-full-6m-read.md))_

## Project Vision

**Seven years ago, financial disaster and digital addiction brought a fledgling artist to rock bottom. The solution? An illustrated diary practice that evolved into a systematic innovation for processing human experience. Now, 50+ artworks (A4 to 1.5 meters) documenting this transformation need an interface worthy of their extraordinary content.**

An **"audiobook meets art gallery"** experience launching Q1 2026 with gallery exhibitions and planned media coverage (Hacker News, art/tech publications).

## Why This Matters

**Portfolio Value:** Widely exhibited, media-covered work bridging fine art and innovative UX  

**Cultural Impact:** A format that could redefine how audiences interact with visual storytelling and personal documentation  

**Creative Partnership:** We're seeking collaborators who thrive on never-before-attempted challenges  

**Visual Ambition:** Think the intimacy of The New York Times' Snow Fall meets the interactivity of a MoMA digital installation

## Core Design Challenges

-  **Hotspot Integration** - Make clickable areas on hand-drawn artwork feel natural, not imposed 

-  **Audio-Visual Harmony** - Design players that complement rather than compete with art 

-  **Intimate Data** - Present time-tracking data (pie charts, daily breakdowns) as art, not analytics 

- **Cross-Device Magic** - Honor artwork detail from phone to desktop • **Elegant Access** - Access prompts that feel like stepping behind the curtain, not hitting a paywall

---

## Essential UI Components

- **Interactive Hotspots** - Invisible at rest; highlight on hover/tap; reveal audio, images, links 

- **Floating Audio Player** - Sequential/Highlights modes, auto-advance toggle, minimize function 

- **Mode Toggle** - Narration / Silent / Plain viewing, instantly switchable  

- **Overlay Panels** - Images, videos, links, about text in consistent modals/panels 

- **Gallery Navigation** - Act-based organization with deep linking capability

---

## Interaction Flows

**Desktop:** Hover to discover → Click to play + reveal content buttons  

**Mobile:** Tap to focus + start audio → Additional buttons for media/about  

**Critical:** Audio continues during exploration; active hotspot stays highlighted

---

## Technical Requirements

-  Responsive design preserving artwork quality at all screen sizes 

- 60fps animations, minimal load times, robust mobile performance

- SVG-based hotspot coordinates with audio synchronization 

- Touch targets ≥44px, accessibility compliance 

- Support for patchy gallery WiFi


*Detailed interaction patterns and user flows are covered in the companion [Interaction Reference Guide](interaction-reference-guide-3m-read.md).*

## Designer Deliverables

- **Visual Concepts** - Style frames for 2-3 creative directions 

- **Interactive Prototypes** - Hotspot behaviors, audio integration, responsive layouts

- **Design System** - Typography, colors, component styles for entire site 

- **Flow Diagrams** - User journeys for key interactions across devices

_We're open to bold creative interpretations that honor the intimate, transformative nature of the work._
