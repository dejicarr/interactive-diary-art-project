# Scrolling Homepage Story Experience

## Creative Brief for Interactive Art Diary Platform

**Project:** Scrolling Homepage Storytelling Experience  
**Target:** Creative professionals and developers  
**Launch:** Q1 2026 alongside main gallery platform  
**Purpose:** Transform visitors into engaged explorers through compelling narrative

---

## Executive Summary

Create a scrolling narrative experience that serves as the emotional gateway to the Interactive Art Diary Platform. This homepage story should guide users through a personal transformation journey using scroll-triggered storytelling, drawing from comprehensive narrative documentation to create an engaging entry point that can be experienced in 3-5 minutes.

The homepage story is the first chapter of the experience, designed to hook and orient visitors before they step into the gallery. While optional, it sets the emotional tone that elevates the rest of the journey.

**The Hook:** This isn't just another portfolio site. It's the first chapter of an unprecedented digital art experience that documents complete personal transformation through systematic artistic practice—from crisis to artistic breakthrough in ~2.5 years.

_This homepage should feel like stepping into a myth—a digital doorway from collapse into creativity, inviting audiences to walk the same path of transformation._

## Your Creative Challenge

**We want YOUR interpretation of how to tell this story through scrolling.**

### **What We're Providing:**

- Comprehensive narrative documents detailing the full transformation journey
- High-resolution photographs of actual diary artworks showing evolution
- Supporting imagery and context from the artist's journey
- Technical specifications for the main gallery platform (for seamless integration)

### **What We Need From You:**

- **Your analysis** of the narrative materials and key story points
- **Your proposal** for how to translate this into compelling scroll storytelling
- **Your recommendation** on story structure: comprehensive vs. abbreviated approach
- **Your creative vision** for visual storytelling, pacing, and user engagement
- **Your timeline and phases** for development and delivery

## Story Assets & Narrative Foundation

### **Core Narrative Documentation**

- Complete transformation story (Acts I-III: Discovery → Devotion → Transformation)
- Individual artwork backstories and evolution details
- Timeline spanning approximately 2.5 years (2017-2020 for this exhibition)
- Personal insights, breakthrough moments, and artistic development

### **Narrative Guidance**

We encourage your creative interpretation, but you may find it helpful to reference the documented story structure:

**For full context, start with:** `[[prologue-backstory-3min-read]]` - Project origins and foundational context  
**Then read:** `[[narrative-exhibition-acts-13m-read]]` - The three-act transformation journey (Discovery → Devotion → Transformation)  
**For quick overview:** `[[narrative-highlights-5min-read]]` - Key themes and beats from both prologue and acts

Consider how this documented progression might translate to scroll-based storytelling, but feel free to propose your own narrative structure.

### **Visual Assets**

- High-resolution scans of 50+ diary artworks (A4 through 1.5-meter pieces)
- Progression documentation showing artistic evolution
- Supporting photographs from the journey
- Behind-the-scenes imagery and context

### **Technical Context**

- Main platform features interactive hotspots, audio narration, and immersive gallery experience
- Homepage story must serve as compelling bridge to main experience
- Performance requirements for potential viral traffic

## Creative References & Inspiration

### **Core Storytelling Examples**

**NY Times Snow Fall** - The pioneering scroll storytelling masterpiece that established the medium  
**LetsFreeCongress.org** - Excellent scroll-based data storytelling that builds emotional momentum through simple, powerful information progression

### **Technical Inspiration**

**ActiveTheory.net** - Aspirational for technical execution quality and attention to detail, though we're not expecting this level of complexity

### **Creative Approaches to Consider**

_Examples only — not requirements. Feel free to propose unexpected metaphors or structures._

- Animated book flipping through diary pages
- Calendar progression showing timeline
- Visual metaphors for transformation
- Data visualization of artistic evolution
- Supporting graphics/icons to enhance mood and themes

---

## Design Tone & Aesthetic Direction

**Desired Emotional Feel:** Intimate, raw, but polished. Cool and quirky, with openness to humor. The experience should honor the vulnerability and authenticity of the diary practice while maintaining professional, gallery-quality presentation.

**Avoid:** Corporate or sterile aesthetics, overly slick agency work that loses the personal, handcrafted essence of the original artworks.

## Key Questions for Your Proposal

### **Story Structure**

- Which story points from the narrative are essential vs. secondary?
- Should this be comprehensive (full story) or abbreviated (key moments)?
- How would you pace the reveal of information through scroll?
- What text can be replaced with visual storytelling?

### **Visual Approach**

- How would you show the artistic evolution from A4 sketches to 1.5m artworks?
- What supporting graphics or illustrations would enhance the narrative?
- How would you create emotional connection without overwhelming users?
- What's your approach to integrating actual artwork with designed elements?
- Should audio play any role in this homepage, or should it remain purely visual/textual? We welcome your perspective.

### **Technical Execution**

- What level of animation complexity do you recommend?
- How would you ensure smooth performance across all devices?
- What's your approach to the transition into the main gallery experience?
- How would you handle potential viral traffic loads?

### **Timeline & Phases**

- What development phases do you propose?
- What are realistic timeframes for each phase? _(We anticipate design & build requiring 6-10 weeks, but welcome your recommendations)_
- What would you need from us and when?
- How would you handle testing and refinement?

## Performance & Integration Requirements

**Core Performance Principles:**

- **Static scroll performance** - Homepage story section loads instantly and scrolls smoothly at 60fps without database calls during scroll interactions
- **Cross-device excellence** - Design for mobile first, then enhance for tablet and desktop
- **Viral traffic ready** - Optimized for potential high-traffic loads with CDN delivery
- **Accessibility compliance** - Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alt text for artworks, high contrast support
- **Iterative testing** - Plan for testing across devices and user types — pacing, transitions, and load times should be validated in prototype before full build

**Gallery Integration:**

- **Visual continuity** - Typography, color progression, and UI styling that bridges to gallery experience
- **Memorable transition moment** - Design a compelling end-of-scroll experience (fade, animation, or symbolic bridge) that makes entering the gallery feel like a natural continuation of the story journey
- **Technical compatibility** - Must integrate smoothly with main platform (Next.js/PostgreSQL architecture — dev team will provide guidance)

---

### **Technical Integration Details**

_For development teams:_

- Fast load times with lazy loading for artwork images
- Consistent artwork presentation approach between story preview and gallery
- Interactive feedback (hover states, transitions) that feels cohesive across platforms
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for touch and mouse interactions

---

## Success Criteria

**Primary Goal:** Transform casual visitors into committed explorers of the main gallery experience

**Specific Engagement Targets:**

- Emotional hook achieved within first 30 seconds of scrolling
- Complete narrative understood within 3-5 minutes
- Smooth, compelling scroll experience across all devices (especially mobile)
- Strong conversion rate from story completion to gallery entry

**Quality Standards:**

- Respectful presentation of personal artistic journey
- Professional execution worthy of gallery exhibition context
- Accessible design that works for diverse audiences

---

## What We Don't Want

- Over-prescribed execution that limits creative interpretation
- Technology for technology's sake without narrative purpose
- Overwhelming complexity that distracts from the story
- Generic scroll experiences that could work for any content
